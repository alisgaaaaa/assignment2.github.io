		Hello! Welcome to my website where I'll share a bit about myself, my hobbies, skills, and interests! To start off, I'm a first-year student at <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/">York University</a>, pursuing my undergraduate degree in <a href="https://futurestudents.yorku.ca/program/information-technology">Information Technology (BA).</a> I'm passionate about technology and enjoy exploring its various aspects. My favorite color is red, and I'm a Libra according to my zodiac sign! Through this platform, I hope to showcase my journey, experiences, and the things that inspire me.

                  I am a proud Filipino-Canadian! I was born in Canada and I have never travelled to the Philippines before. However, living in Canada has provided opportunities for growth and learning while staying connected to my Filipino roots. It's been a journey of embracing diversity, understanding different perspectives, and appreciating the values instilled by my Filipino heritage, such as strong family bonds, resilience, and hospitality. Overall, being Filipino and living in Canada has given me a unique perspective, allowing me to cherish the beauty of diversity and carry the richness of my cultural heritage wherever life takes me.

		Playing volleyball, crocheting, and indulging in video games are three distinct yet fulfilling passions in my life. Crocheting is my creative outlet, allowing me to unwind and express myself through intricate patterns and colorful yarns. The video above is a tutorial I am currently following! It's a therapeutic activity that brings a sense of accomplishment with each completed project, whether it's a cozy blanket or a cute amigurumi. Volleyball brings a sense of camaraderie and competition, fostering teamwork and physical fitness. The adrenaline rush during a well-executed spike or a perfectly timed block is unmatched. On the other hand, video games provide an immersive escape into fantastical worlds, challenging my strategic thinking and reflexes. Whether it's exploring vast open worlds or competing in intense multiplayer matches, gaming offers endless entertainment and a sense of achievement. Each of these hobbies contributes to my overall well-being, providing a balance of physical activity, creativity, and mental stimulation in my daily life.

                 During my first year at university, I learned a lot of important skills. I got better at managing my time, which helped me balance schoolwork, activities, and personal stuff. I also got better at thinking critically, which means I can understand things better and make good arguments. I improved my communication skills by writing papers, doing presentations, and talking in class. I learned how to research things well using books and the internet. I also got better at handling new situations and challenges, like meeting new people and dealing with tough classes. Working with others on projects taught me how to cooperate and work as a team. I also got more comfortable using technology for schoolwork, like doing research and using online tools. These skills have made me more confident in handling university life and getting ready for my future.
